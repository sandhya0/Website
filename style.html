    <h2>1. Ballet</h2>
    <p>
        Tutus, pointe shoes and men in tights are what come to mind when someone speaks of ballet. Yet Ballet is so much
        more than that. Said to be the most difficult genre to master, ballet is a poised style of dance that is at the
        core of all forms of dance. It is usually set, but not limited to, orchestrated music and is often the first
        dance style a child will experience as they begin their dance training. Ballet shoes are usually worn until the
        dancers feet have developed enough strength to progress into pointe shoes. This often happens around the age of
        12 and only after the students have been given permission by their teacher. Ballet is an excellent teaching tool
        for all dancers as it is a complex mixture of technique, coordination and musicality.

    <p>

        fundamentals and creates many more greater movements that do not adhere to the strict rules of ballet and
        modern. There are different categories of contemporary dance such as Contemporary Ballet and Contemporary Jazz.
        Contemporary dance is often danced to all types of music and in bare feet with non-traditional costumes.

        power moves (windmill, tomas, airtrax and so on), style moves, toprock, downrock (footwork), and freezes (chair,
        airchair and so on). Many of moves come from gymnastics and kung-fu. Breakdancers dance with breakbeats. The
        difficulty of their skills decides the better b-boy. One of the biggest breakdance contests in the world is

    <h2>7. Bhangra And Giddha</h2>
    <p>
        Bhangra is a type of traditional dance of the Indian subcontinent, originating in Punjab.The dance
        was associated primarily with the spring harvest festival Baisakhi, and it is from one of the major products of
        the harvest—bhang (hemp)—that bhangra drew its name. In a typical performance, several dancers executed vigorous
        kicks, leaps, and bends of the body to the accompaniment of short songs called boliyan and, most significantly,
        to the beat of a dhol (double-headed drum). Struck with a heavy beater on one end and with a lighter stick on
        the other, the dhol imbued the music with a syncopated (accents on the weak beats), swinging rhythmic character
        that has generally remained the hallmark of any music that has come to bear the bhangra name. Where Giddha is a
        popular
        folk dance of women in Punjab region of India and Pakistan. Giddha varies from other forms of traditional
        Punjabi dance in that it does not require the two-headed barrel dhol drum to be performed. Instead, women stand
        in a circle formation and clap rhythms. A lead woman will recite a boli (lyrics) with a refrain that the entire
        circle then repeats. The whole form of a giddha song is worked through in this call and response form. Giddha
        details stories of women's lives, including marriage, sexuality, domestic life, and homesickness.

    <h2>8. jazz</h2>
    <p>
        Jazz is the most popular style of dance among dancers. Jazz pulls from all dance styles mixing them together to
        create a high energy style that knows no boundaries. It has been influenced by ballet, modern, tap, hip-hop,
        African dance and many more styles. Jazz is most often set to up beat popular songs of the time. Jazz shoes are
        worn for this style and are typically a leather split sole allowing the dancers foot more freedom to bend and
        move. Due to the upbeat music, power packed moves and limitless style, it isn’t hard to see why this is the most
        popular dance style!

    <h2>9. Lyrical</h2>
    <p>
        Though the basis of lyrical is ballet it also encompasses both jazz and modern. It is dynamic while
        instantaneously subtle. Lyrical focuses on conveying feelings and emotions through movement and is usually set
        to popular songs. Lyrical is often danced wearing Twyla’s, Dance Paws, FootUndeez or bare feet. Though proper
        dance techniques are important, the true heart of lyrical is found in its expressive nature.
