    <p>
        Dance has been an essential piece of function, customs, festivities and amusement since before the introduction
        of the most punctual human civic establishments. Numerous contemporary move structures can be followed back to
        recorded, conventional, stylist, and ethnic moves of the antiquated period. Many dances of the early periods
        were performed to celebrate festivals, on important or seasonal occasions such as crop harvest, or births and
        weddings. Ritual dances may also be performed in temples and during religious festivals like Indian classical
        dance, Cham dance of Tibet, Cultural dance of Nepal etc. There are lots of forms of dance spread  whole over the
        world. Bhangra, Ballet, Folk, Contemporary, Aerial, Belly, Hip pop, Break dance, Salsa are some of the famous
        dance forms.
         My point of view towards dance is, It is beautiful form of art that helps you to express yourself without
        saying a word. If I connect dance with my personal life, I was very young when I saw people dancing in different
        ways ( different forms) which I love to view. I used to enjoy the music and movement but till then i hadn't
        practised it. while I was in my higher secondary level, my classmates were preparing some dance for following
        event.seeing them practising I used to try some steps and my dance teacher saw that. He called me towards and
        asked me to copy some steps after him. With nervousness in my face I was able to do that which gift me a chance
        to perform in an upcoming event but I was so  nervous that I deny first then finally me along with my group were
        ready to preform in front of a mass. After my performance I was able to collect so many good comments ,
        advises and suggestion because of which I was inspired to open this website. Through this website, I wanna
        show world that every person is able to express themselves through dance.
